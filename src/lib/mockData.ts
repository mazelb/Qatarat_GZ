  mission: "Our mission is to provide immediate relief and sustainable solutions to the people of Gaza, addressing both emergency needs and long-term development goals. We believe in empowering communities through access to clean water, healthcare, education, and economic opportunities.",
  vision: "We envision a future where all people in Gaza live with dignity, self-sufficiency, and hope. A future where children have access to quality education, families have sustainable livelihoods, and communities thrive with adequate infrastructure and services.",
  values: "Integrity, compassion, sustainability, accountability, and respect guide all of our work. We operate with transparency and ensure that donations directly benefit those in need. We respect the dignity of all people and involve local communities in program design and implementation.",
  story: "Qatarat Gaza (Droplets of Gaza) was founded in response to the escalating humanitarian crisis in Gaza. What began as a small group of volunteers collecting donations for emergency relief has grown into an organization implementing sustainable programs across Gaza. Our journey started with the belief that every drop of aid, every act of kindness, contributes to a larger impact â€“ just as small droplets of water come together to sustain life.\n\nOver the years, we have expanded our reach and deepened our impact. We've built water wells, supported orphans, implemented healthcare initiatives, and responded to multiple emergencies. Through it all, we've remained committed to our core belief: that the people of Gaza deserve to live with dignity and hope.",
